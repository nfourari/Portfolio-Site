        <h2>üëãüèΩ About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As a computer science student at the University of Central Florida, I have dedicated my academic and personal pursuits to understanding the intricate world of technology and software engineering. From mastering programming languages like Python, Java, and C++ to diving deep into the realms of artificial intelligence and full-stack development, my journey has been one of constant learning and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology, to me, is more than just coding. It's about creating impactful solutions that can change lives, improve systems, and drive innovation. I believe in a future where software development plays a critical role in shaping how we interact with the world, and I aspire to be at the forefront of that change.
        </p>
        <p>
          My personal manifesto is to continue pushing the boundaries of what I know, taking on challenges that push me out of my comfort zone, and collaborating with like-minded individuals who share the same passion for innovation. I aim to contribute to open-source projects, continue enhancing my full-stack skills, and ultimately become a leading figure in the software engineering community.
